# StackageApp

StackageApp is a community-powered, self-policing fully mobile social media platform for sharing information about technology. In the application, authenticated users can make and share posts, view and filter a feed of others' posts, approve posts for inclusion in the feed, make a profile, view and connect with other users, message connections, and more. Limited features are also available to unauthenticated users when they sign in as a guest. StackageApp is an open source project.
